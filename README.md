# YuTreat
I have created this project to try out my React Js skills and play with realtime data using Swiggy API .

- Added Search Functionality and filter options to reduce search time.
- Added Restaurant Menu and Cart Menu.
- Accurate Price Calculation and price adjusting as per real time offers.
- Handled missing values to take default values from restaurant data
- Add clean print option (No irrelavent website info in print receipt)

Note : As this is a frontend project so make sure to add "Allow CORS" extension on your browser to run this project on your local.
